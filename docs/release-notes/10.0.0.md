# Statistical Methods Library 10.0.0

Release date: 2023-02-08

## Synopsis

Correct the columns in the Ratio of Means output.

## Changes

In the Ratio of Means imputation method the strata and auxiliary columns
were incorrectly output. This was not compliant with either the
specification or the method's documentation. This change removes these
columns from the output.

## Notes

Since both strata and auxiliary columns must be passed to the method as part
of the input dataset, users should join these columns onto the output via
the reference and period columns if strata and auxiliary information is
required in the output dataset. This was always the specified behaviour
however this non-compliance was only detected in this release.

Although this is a bug fix, the output is potentially incompatible with code
written against previous releases if it relies on the non-compliant
behaviour. As such this release is a major version change.
