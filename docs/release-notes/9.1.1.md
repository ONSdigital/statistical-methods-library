# Statistical Methods Library 9.1.1

Release date: 2023-02-07

## Synopsis

This release removes a piece of unused code in back data handling.

## Changes

In the Ratio of Means imputation method, an attempt was made to drop a
non-existent column (the input target column) from the back data. This was
silently failing and so has been removed.

## Notes

This change has no functional impact.
