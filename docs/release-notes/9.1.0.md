# Statistical Methods Library 9.1.0

Release date: 2023-02-06

## Synopsis

This release addresses an issue applying the link filter when using back
data in the Ratio of Means imputation method.

## Changes

In the Ratio of Means imputation method, link filtering now happens after
back data is validated and if there is back data it will be added to the
input data before applying the filter. This fixes an issue where all the
back data was filtered out in link calculations when using a link filter.

## Notes

Any data produced using a prior version of the Ratio of Means method relying
on the link filter and back data should be considered suspect and it is
recommended to repeat such runs with this new version.
