# Statistical Methods Library 13.3.0

Release date: 2025-07-16

## Synopsis

This release imputation method accepts and appropriately handles cases where a value has been overridden by manual intervention or manual construction.

## Changes

The imputation method now has an optional imputation parameter named "manual_construction_col." When this argument is given together with the relevant column in the "input_df" dataframe, the method performs the manual construction and forwards imputes from manual construction for non-responders.


## Notes

When manual construction or forward imputation from manual construction is applied, the output will have the markers MC or FIMC.
This change has no impact on the link calculation.
