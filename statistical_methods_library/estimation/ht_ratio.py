    Perform Horvitz-Thompson estimation of design weights and calibration factors
    using Expansion and Ratio estimation.

    ###Arguments
    * `input_df`: The input data frame.
    * `unique_identifier_col`: The name of the column containing the unique identifier
      for the contributors.
    * `period_col`: The name of the column containing the period information for
      the contributor.
    * `strata_col`: The name of the column containing the strata of the contributor.
    * `sample_marker_col`: The name of the column containing a marker
      for whether to include the contributor in the sample or only in the
      population. This column must be boolean where false means
      to exclude the contributor from the sample and true means the contributor
      will be included in the sample count.
    * `adjustment_marker_col`: The name of the column containing a marker for whether
      the contributor is in scope (I), out of scope (O) or dead (D).
    * `h_value_col`: The name of the column containing the boolean h value for the strata.
    * out_of_scope_full: A parameter that specifies what type of out of scope
      to run when an `out_of_scope_marker_col` is provided. True specifies
      that the out of scope is used on both sides of the adjustment fraction.
      False specifies that the out of scope is used only on the denominator of
      the adjustment fraction.
    * auxiliary_col: The name of the column containing the auxiliary value for
      the contributor.
    * calibration_group_col: The name of the column containing the calibration
      group for the contributor.
    * unadjusted_design_weight_col: The name of the column which will contain
      the unadjusted design weight for the contributor. The column isn't
      output unless a name is provided.
    * design_weight_col: The name of the column which will contain the
      design weight for the contributor. Defaults to `design_weight`.
    * calibration_factor_col: The name of the column which will contain the
      calibration factor for the contributor. Defaults to `calibration_factor`.

    ###Returns

    A data frame containing the estimated weights. The exact columns depend on
    the type of estimation performed as specified below.

    ####Common Columns

    In all cases the data frame will contain:

    * `period_col`
    * `strata_col`
    * `design_weight_col`

    ####Ratio Estimation

    In the case of either Separate or Combined Ratio Estimation, the data frame
    will also contain the column specified by `calibration_factor_col`.

    ####Combined Ratio Estimation

    When Combined Ratio Estimation is performed, the data frame will also
    contain the column specified by `calibration_factor_col`.

    ###Notes

    Either both or neither of `adjustment_marker_col` and `h_value_col` must be specified.
    If they are then the design weight is adjusted using birth-death
    adjustment, otherwise it is not. In addition, since birth-death adjustment
    is per-stratum, the `h_value_col` must not change within a given period and
    stratum.

    If `out_of_scope_full` is also specified, out of scope adjustment
    is performed during birth-death adjustment.

    If `auxiliary_col` is specified then one of Separate Ratio or Combined Ratio
    estimation is performed. This depends on whether `calibration_group_col`
    is specified. If so then Combined Ratio estimation is performed, otherwise
    Separate Ratio estimation is performed. If `auxiliary_col` is not
    specified then only Expansion estimation is performed and specifying
    `calibration_group_col` raises an error.

    `unadjusted_design_weight_col` is only in the output if a column name is specified.

    All specified input columns must be fully populated. If not an error is
    raised. Since `design_weight_col` and `calibration_factor_col` are both
    output columns this does not apply to them, and any values they contain prior
    to calling the method will be ignored.
